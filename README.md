I make programming stuff in my spare time. Passionate about parsers, gamedesign and procedural generation.

Most of my games are on [itch.io](https://llesha.itch.io).

Relevant repos I (co)authored:
* [Geomc logic language](https://github.com/konichiva-geom/GeometryChecker)
* [Image to code telegram bot](https://github.com/gudarikon/image-to-code)
